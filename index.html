				<h2>Dance Dance Revolution</h2>
				<p id="text">Dance Dance Revolution, also known as DDR is one of the most iconic games that has ever existed. Originally started in Japan, 
				its a game that requires having to hit moving arrows with your feet by following the rhythm and timing it with the rhythm of the music. 
				This game is not only known internationally by many, but has featured many genres of music over its entire life span from all over the world! 
				Even to this day, the game is still very deeply loved and supported by its creators as it not only has online capabilities for score tracking
				and online music updates, but also they're constant release of new cabinets and releases of new versions of the game!</p>

				<h2>Beatmani IIDX</h2>
				<p id="text">Beatmani IIDX, which is also just shortened to IIDX, is another game that is internationally know. Infact, you'll find that pretty much
				every game on this list is well known outside of Japan! Though this is a rhythm game, the premise and learning curve of this game are ALOT
				more difficult. This is a 7 key game setup with a turntable on either it's left, or right side (depends on the side you play on). The game
				has a similar premise in which you have to hit the key or scratch the turntable that corrosponds to the button as it moves down the screen. 
				Not only is there more on the screen to keep up with, but the timing is also very strict compared to other games. This game also has support
				for online score tracking and updates to new versions. As is true for all other rhythm games in this day and age~</p>

				<h2>Sound Voltex</h2>
				<p id="text">Sound Voltex is a game built fairly similarly to IIDX, with exceptions to its button layout, and replacing the scratcher with two knobs
				on both the left and right side of the controller. Though this is primarily a 1 player game, it can be linked up with other machines within
				the same arcade center to play against others with the song being synced between up to 4 total setups! This game although seems easy within
				it's lower leveled songs, does have a very big increase in difficulty past certain levels as more is introduced during the play of the song.
				Overall, this game does feature something that no other rhythm game in this list has feature yet, and that's the ability to print out special
				collecible cards that you unlock via a system called the "Generator -Real Model-", which uses additional credits to print.</p>

				<h2>Jubeat</h2>
				<p id="text">Jubeat is where alot of what has been "the same" kind of starts to change. Though this game came out before Sound Voltex, but much later
				compared to IIDX or DDR, this game has a whole 16 buttons to use! Thats right folks, I said 16. Though this game is pretty compact, it's size
				isn't that much larger compared to SDVX. It supports several online feature such as local play, music updates, and score saving. This game is pretty
				popular amongst many rhythm gamers as not only is it easy to pickup in the early levels, but it also has one of the biggest selection of music.
				This is overal one of my personal favorites and is what really got me into rhythm gaming!</p>

				<h2>Pop'n Music</h2>
				<p id="text">Pop'n Music is one of the older style rhythm games. Although it's creation was around the same time as IIDX and DDR, it doesn't hold as much
				popularity due to its very difficult learning curve. It has slowly been gaining popularity again with the crow thanks to its cute characters,
				it is still deemed a very difficult game. Consisting only of a total of 9 large buttons, it is very strict on its timing and tends to have a lot
				higher levels compared to other games. Not much can be said about this game other than to be very prepared to have some sore arms and hands for
				having to slap all those buttons very quickly and on time~</p>

				<h3>Just the tip of it all</h3>

				<section>
					<p id="sub">This isn't the only maker of rhythm games. There are several other companies that have made games of similar styling over the years. Some
					have closed down or had to stop, where as others still create them to this day. Companies such as Sega, Bandai Namco, Andamiro, and even Konami
					(Who actually owns the Bemani Trademark) keep innovating and coming out with other games using different technology. Of course, rhythm games aren't 
					the only arcade games that I love. But they are what actually got me started on arcades. And just for that, they hold a special place in my heart. </p>
